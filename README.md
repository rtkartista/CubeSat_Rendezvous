# CubeSat_Rendezvous
This repo contains code of a controller design for two satellite approach. It is assumed they have electromagnetic dipoles to achieve the docking. I have designed a LQR and a SMC controller for the system, whose parameters are trimmed using GA in MATLAB. Additionally, It contains code to simulate the trajectory of a sat around earth, the sun's trajectory around the earth.
